# Welcome to My Journey ðŸš€

This is my very first blog post on this site. The goal of this blog is simple: to document my journey of reinvention in tech, creativity, and life. Iâ€™ll mix **daily notes**, experiments, reflections, and messy learning â€” because thatâ€™s how progress actually happens.

Iâ€™ll share what I build, what I learn, and how I feel along the way. Some days will be structured, others messy, but I want to capture the real process.

## Daily Notes â€” 2025-08-19

- **Today's Action:** Implemented and tested multiple improvements to the site and content pipeline: diagnosed and fixed localized project markdown issues (non-breaking spaces), made translations tolerant of both nested and dotted JSON keys, prepared translation-aware navigation, added a generic fallback image and wired it into blog components (LastPost/BlogPost), and updated the static data schema so the fallback image is available site-wide.

- **What I completed:**
  - Found and fixed the YAML/indentation issue that hid project cards in some locales.
  - Wrote a more robust i18n helper (supports dotted & nested keys).
  - Updated `staticData` schema and `allStaticData.json` to include `fallbackImage`.
  - Updated `LastPost.astro` and `BlogPost.astro` to use the fallback image and avoid crashes when `image` is missing.
  - Generated a `fallback.webp` placeholder image.
  - Prepared localized blog templates (this post) for EN/FR/ES/DE.

- **Today's Feeling:** optimistic but a bit tired â€” steady progress is better than perfect leaps.

- **Quick thought:** This project is taking more time than I expected, but the work is meaningful and building helpful foundation pieces.

- **Personal:** a few application/submission tasks done across personal work; small wins today.
