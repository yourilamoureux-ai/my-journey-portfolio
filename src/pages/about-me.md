My reinvention began with a one-way ticket. After my Salvadoran girlfriend's work contract in Canada was suddenly rescinded, she had to return home. I had a stable corporate career and a clear path, but I knew my future was with her. I packed my bags, left my life behind, and moved to El Salvador to start over.

While I fell in love with the country, I quickly hit a professional wall. The jobs I was qualified for simply weren't there.

##  Trading a Rulebook for a Terminal

My career was built on mastering complex systemsâ€”first managing global insurance claims in Germany while traveling the world as a professional MMA judge. I was used to having a plan. For the first time, I had none. So, I decided to build my own.

I traded rulebooks for a command-line terminal and dove headfirst into the world of technology. I spent my days earning GenAI certifications and my nights learning to code by building small, playful apps. It was a pivot from managing systems of people to building systems with code.


## Learning by Building (and Breaking)

My curriculum was pure experimentation. I built simple web story apps for my nephews, a recipe website, and even tried launching a business that failed spectacularlyâ€”but taught me invaluable lessons. Each project, successful or not, was a step forward, showing me the incredible potential of combining creativity with technology.

##  More Than Just Code

This journey took on a profound new meaning when we discovered we're expecting our first child in January 2026. Suddenly, the late nights spent debugging code weren't just for self-improvement; they were about building a new foundation for my growing family.

My mission is to share this entire process in publicâ€”the wins, the bugs, and the lessons learned along the way. I'm not a tech guru; I'm a traveler on a new path, and I hope my story can inspire others who are looking to forge their own.

## The Road Ahead

My focus now is on documenting my projects and building a community of fellow learners and creators. This website is the home for that journey. I believe that by sharing our work openly, we can learn faster and build better things together.

## Behind the Screen

When Iâ€™m not in front of a keyboard, you can usually find me in the kitchen. Iâ€™m a passionate cook (I even wrote a cookbook once) and Iâ€™m always on the hunt for the best local food. My past life in the MMA world means Iâ€™m always ready for a deep-dive conversation about combat sports. I'm a native French speaker from Canada, spent a decade in Germany becoming fluent in German, and am now happily embracing Spanish in El Salvador. Letâ€™s connect.

I'm **Youri Lamoureux**, and I thank you for reading this.
