**Allô Mathis, je te montre...** is a simple web story app I built for my nephews. The goal was to create a fun, interactive way for them to read bedtime stories together. This project was a critical step in my journey of reinvention in El Salvador.

This app was my first major attempt at "vibe coding" to test the limits of what I could accomplish with GenAI as my creative partner. Developed with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it emphasizes speed, interactivity, and a playful, scene-based architecture for storytelling.

## 🧩 Features
* Simple, single-page navigation to switch between stories.
* Interactive elements with custom audio for key phrases.
* Themed stories with text and illustrations.

## 💡 Technologies used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom keyframe animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Netlify

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this project was to explore how far I could go creating an engaging web app from scratch, relying only on GenAI and "vibe coding." My goal was to make educational and entertaining stories for my 3-year-old nephew while proving to myself that I could transform an idea into a fully functional app through creativity, iteration, and curiosity.
