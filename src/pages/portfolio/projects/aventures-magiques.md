**Les Aventures Magiques** is the first interactive storybook web app I built for my nephews. It's a simple, single-page application designed to be a colorful and engaging storytelling experience for young children, all contained within a single HTML file.

Developed entirely with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, this project was a foundational exercise in web development fundamentals. It combines **Tailwind CSS** for rapid layout with custom CSS animations and the browser's built-in **Web Speech API** for a text-to-speech feature.

## üß© Features

- Character selection screen to personalize the stories for each nephew.
- A library of multiple, distinct stories with unique scenes.
- Interactive, scene-by-scene progression with images and text.
- Built-in text-to-speech functionality that reads stories aloud in French.
- Playful, kid-friendly design with custom CSS animations for a "magical" feel.

## üí° Technologies used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (with custom keyframe animations)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (for all application logic, state, and DOM manipulation)
- **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN)
- **Web Speech API** (for the text-to-speech feature)
- **Netlify** (for hosting and deployment)

## üéØ Objective

This was one of my very first projects, born from a desire to learn web development from the ground up. The objective was to see if I could create a complete, interactive application using only the fundamental building blocks of the web. It was a deep dive into DOM manipulation, event handling, and managing application state without the help of a framework, serving as a critical confidence-builder at the start of my tech journey.
