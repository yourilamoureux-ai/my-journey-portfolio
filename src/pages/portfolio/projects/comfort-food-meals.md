## 🎯 Objective

This project was a challenge to myself to move beyond static sites and build a full-stack, dynamic web application. The goal was to learn and implement key concepts like component-based architecture, state management with React Hooks, and how to integrate a backend service like Firebase for features like user authentication and a persistent database.
